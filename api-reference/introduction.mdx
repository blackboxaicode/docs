The BLACKBOX AI API provides programmatic access to our advanced generative models. You can integrate our technology into your own applications to power features like conversational chat, automated content creation, image generation, and much more.

This documentation will guide you through authenticating, understanding our models, and making your first API calls.

BLACKBOXAI uses OpenRouter under the hood for managing our vast models and its request and response schemas are very similar to the OpenAI Chat API, with a few small differences. It normalizes the schema across models and providers.
