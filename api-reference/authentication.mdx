All requests to the BLACKBOX API must be authenticated using an API key. Requests made without a valid API key will fail.

## Finding Your API Key

1. Navigate to the [API Keys section](https://www.blackbox.ai/dashboard) of your BLACKBOX dashboard.
2. Your API key will be displayed on this page.
3. Click the copy icon to copy the key to your clipboard.

<Info>
    **Important:** Treat your API key like a password\! Do not share it publicly
    or commit it to version control.

## Making Authenticated Requests

To authenticate your API calls, you must include your API key in the `Authorization` header of your request. The header should be formatted as follows:

`Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with the key you copied from your dashboard.

### Example

Here is an example of an authenticated request using cURL:

```bash
curl https://www.blackbox.ai/api/v1/chat \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "blackbox-chat",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user", 
        "content": "Hello world"
      }
    ]
  }'
```
