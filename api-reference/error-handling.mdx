description: "Understand how our API handles errors"

Our API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general, codes in the `2xx` range indicate success, codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted), and codes in the `5xx` range indicate an error with our servers.

## HTTP Status Codes

Here's a summary of the primary HTTP response codes you'll encounter:

-   `200 OK`: Everything worked as expected.
-   `400 Bad Request`: Request is not acceptable, often due to missing a required parameter.
-   `401 Unauthorized`: No valid API key was provided.
-   `429 Too Many Requests`: You're hitting the rate limit.
-   `500 Internal Server Error`: We had a problem with our server. Try again later.

## Error Response Body

When an error occurs, the response body will contain a JSON object with details about the error. This helps you understand what went wrong and how to fix it.
Following is an examaple for it

```json
{
    "error": {
        "message": "Invalid API key provided.",
        "type": "invalid_request_error",
        "code": "invalid_api_key"
    }
}
```
