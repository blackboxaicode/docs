Discover the powerful capabilities that make BLACKBOX CLI the ultimate AI-powered terminal assistant for developers.


## Project Development

Complete project lifecycle management from initialization to deployment.

- **Auto Setup**: Initialize projects with dependencies and proper structure
- **Code Generation**: Create functions, APIs, and features from descriptions
- **Architecture Planning**: Get recommendations for scalable project structures

```bash
> create a React TypeScript project with routing and authentication
> generate a REST API for a blog with CRUD operations
```

## Debugging & Testing

Intelligent error detection and automated testing capabilities.

- **Smart Debugging**: Identify and fix compilation and runtime errors
- **Auto Testing**: Generate unit tests and integration tests
- **Security Analysis**: Detect vulnerabilities and performance issues

```bash
> find and fix the authentication bug in my login system
> generate comprehensive unit tests for my user service
```

## Build & Deployment

Automated workflows for building and deploying applications.

- **Build Automation**: Handle compilation, bundling, and optimization
- **Dependency Management**: Install and manage project dependencies
- **CI/CD Setup**: Configure deployment pipelines and environments

```bash
> set up a production build pipeline with optimization
> configure Docker containers for my application
```

## Multi-Language Support

Comprehensive support for modern development stacks.

**Frontend**: React, Vue.js, Angular, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS  
**Backend**: Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Express.js, FastAPI  
**Database**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Prisma, TypeORM  
**DevOps**: Docker, AWS, GCP, Git, Jest, Webpack

```bash
> convert this JavaScript function to TypeScript with proper types
> create a Python FastAPI equivalent of this Express.js route
```

## Intelligent File Management

Create, edit, and organize files through natural language commands.

- **Smart Creation**: Generate project structures with simple descriptions
- **Bulk Operations**: Modify multiple files simultaneously with consistent formatting
- **Intelligent Search**: Find files by content, functionality, or patterns
