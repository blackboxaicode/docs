## 3. Start your first session

Open a new terminal window and start an interactive chat session:

```bash
blackbox session
# or use the short alias
blackbox s
```

## 4. Ask your first question

Let's start with exploring BLACKBOX CLI's capabilities. Try one of these commands:

```
> what can you help me build today?
```

```
> show me what programming languages you support
```

If you're in an existing project, you can ask about your codebase:

```
> analyze this project and tell me what it does
```

```
> what files are in this directory?
```

```
> help me understand the project structure
```

You can also ask for project ideas and guidance:

```
> suggest a beginner-friendly web development project
```

```
> what's the best way to structure a Python API project?
```

<Note>
  BLACKBOX CLI reads your files as needed - you don't have to manually add context. It can analyze your entire project structure and provide intelligent assistance.
</Note>

## 5. Create your first project

Let's start by creating a simple project from scratch:

```
> create a simple todo list web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
```

```
> build a basic calculator app with a clean interface
```

```
> create a personal portfolio website template
```

BLACKBOX CLI will:

1. Create the necessary files and folders
2. Write the complete code for your project
3. Set up proper file structure
4. Provide instructions for running the project

<Note>
  BLACKBOX CLI can create complete projects from scratch, including all necessary files, dependencies, and configuration.
</Note>

## 6. Make code improvements

Now let's enhance existing code. Try these improvement tasks:

```
> add responsive design to my website
```

```
> improve the styling of my todo app with modern CSS
```

```
> add form validation to my contact form
```

```
> optimize my JavaScript code for better performance
```

BLACKBOX CLI will:

* Analyze your existing code
* Suggest and implement improvements
* Maintain code functionality while enhancing features
* Explain the changes made

## 7. Debug and troubleshoot

BLACKBOX CLI excels at finding and fixing issues:

```
> my website isn't displaying correctly on mobile devices - fix it
```

```
> there's an error when I click the submit button - debug this
```

```
> my CSS styles aren't applying properly - help me fix this
```

```
> optimize my code to load faster
```

BLACKBOX CLI will:

* Identify the root cause of issues
* Provide detailed explanations
* Implement fixes automatically
* Test solutions to ensure they work
