BLACKBOX AI Remote Agent introduces Slack Integration, allowing you to interact with remote cloud agents directly from Slack channels. The only multi-agent Slack app for remote task executions. This feature provides a convenient way to assign tasks to agents without needing to access the web platform manually. Simply connect your Blackbox remote account to Slack and start using the agent as you would from the browser.

Once configured, the Blackbox agent app is added to the channel.

### How It Works

Using Slack is straightforward and mirrors the manual process of selecting a repository, branch, and entering a task on the Blackbox Cloud platform:

- **Start a Task**: Simply type the command `/blackbox` and give the prompt with repo and branch details. Alternatively, use `/task` command to fill a form with the details to start a task.

- **Monitor Progress**: Once you create your first task, you can see its progress via continuous updates by the agent. You can confirm the same from the browser UI as well.

- **Control Tasks**: You can stop the agent at any moment, give it follow-up or correction prompts, stop or resume the tasks, etc., all from Slack.

- **Multiple Threads**: You can have multiple threads for multiple tasks running simultaneously.

- **Select Different AI Agents/Models**: Choose from various AI models and providers such as Blackbox, Claude, Codex, or Gemini for each task, allowing you to select the best agent tailored to specific requirements.

- **Full Functionality via Slack**: Perform all actions available in the browser UI directly from Slack by texting the agent, including task creation, monitoring progress, controlling tasks, and managing settings without needing to access the web platform.

### Available Commands

The Slack integration supports the following commands to interact with the Blackbox agent. You can use these commands directly in your Slack channel to manage tasks, API keys, and more.

| Command | Description | Usage/Arguments |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| `/blackbox <description>` | Create tasks using natural language, no forms! | `<description>` (e.g., "Fix login bug in my-repo") |
| `/task [task-id] <description>` | Smart create/continue | Create a new task or continue an existing task. |
| `/api-keys [set\|delete] <provider> [key]` | Manage API keys | Manage your AI service API keys. |
| `/github [set\|delete] [token]` | Manage GitHub access | Manage your GitHub token. |
| `/my-tasks [status\|keyword]` | List your recent tasks | Optional filter by [status] or [keyword]. |
| `/setup [link]` | Connect your account or check status | Set up your account for task creation. |
| `/task-status <task-id>` | Get detailed task information | Check the status of a specific task. |

#### Sample Usage

Here are some practical examples of how to use the Slack commands for common development tasks:

- **Starting a new feature**: `/blackbox Add a user profile page with avatar upload functionality to the main branch of my-web-app repo`
- **Bug fixing**: `/blackbox Fix the null pointer exception in the login module on the develop branch of auth-service repo`
