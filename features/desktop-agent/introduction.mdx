## Best Practices

### Choose the Right AI Model

Your experience with BlackBox is shaped by your choice of large language model (LLM). The LLM handles all the planning, while BlackBox manages the execution. When selecting an LLM, consider its tool compatibility, unique strengths, and any associated costs to get the best results for your workflow.

### Keep Sessions Efficient

LLMs have context windows, which limit how much conversation history they can remember. If you exceed this limit, earlier parts of your session may be forgotten. Keep an eye on your token usage and start new sessions when needed to maintain optimal performance.

### Enable Only What You Need

Activating too many extensions or tools can impact performance. For the best experience, enable only the essential extensions and tools. This helps BlackBox select the right tool, saves context window space, and keeps you within provider limits.

### Teach BlackBox Your Preferences

Help BlackBox remember your preferred ways of working. Use `.blackboxhints` or other context files for permanent project preferences, and leverage the Memory extension for things you want BlackBox to recall dynamically. Both approaches help save valuable context space while keeping your preferences accessible.
