## What are Extensions?

Extensions are add-ons that provide a way to extend the functionality of BLACKBOX AI by connecting with applications and tools you already use in your workflow. These extensions can be used to add new features, access data and resources, or integrate with other systems.

Extensions are based on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), so you can connect BLACKBOX AI to a wide ecosystem of capabilities, enabling seamless integration with your existing development environment and tools.

## Getting Started with Extensions

Manage extensions through the extensions tab on the right side of the application. Search for the extension you want and add it to extend the powers of your AI agent and what it can do for you.

## Accessing Extensions

Navigate to the extensions tab on the right side of the application to explore and manage your extensions.
