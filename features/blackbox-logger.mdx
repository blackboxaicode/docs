## Overview

Blackbox AI Logger is an innovative AI tool designed to revolutionize server log monitoring and error management. Powered by ElevenLabs' advanced speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities, it continuously scans millions of server logs to detect and resolve errors in real-time, minimizing downtime and promoting smarter coding practices.

The system provides instant engineer notification upon error detection, automated issue resolution before service disruption, and an interactive voice agent that can explain error contexts, analyze code repositories for root causes, suggest fixes, and even assist with implementation. It's an all-in-one end-to-end solution for proactive server error management.

## Getting Started

Blackbox AI Logger is available as an npm package for easy integration into your projects. Install it via:

```bash
npm install @blackbox_ai/ai-logs-watcher
```

### Basic Setup

Import and initialize the logger in your application:

```javascript
import { Ailogw, ElevenLabsVoiceProvider, PrepareCallContext } from "@blackbox_ai/ai-logs-watcher";

const voiceProvider = new ElevenLabsVoiceProvider({
    credentials: {
        apiKey: process.env["ELEVENLABS_API_KEY"]!
    }
});

const ailogwatch = new Ailogw({
    name: "vercel",
    log: true,
    twilio: {
        numberFrom: process.env["AILOGW_NUMBER_FROM"]   // Using Twilio test number for "from"
    },
    voice: voiceProvider,
    polling: {
        delay: "1000:ms",
        tailAmount: 10
    },
    events: {
        async alert({ options, logs, diagnostic, sendSms, voice }) {
            void options, logs;
            const numberTo = process.env["AILOGW_NUMBER_TO"]!;
            switch (diagnostic.raw.status) {
                case "warning":
                case "normal": {
                    // await sendSms(numberTo, diagnostic.formatted);
                    return;
                }
                case "critical": {
                    if (voice && voice instanceof ElevenLabsVoiceProvider) {
                        const context: PrepareCallContext = {
                            githubRepositoryUrl: "https://github.com/your-repo/your-project",
                            namespace: options.name,
                            "the current nodejs version": "20.0.1",
                            "the database": "sqlite",
                            "emergency contact": "Your Name, Title at Company, phone number +xxxxxxxxxx"
                        };
                        const call = await voice.prepareCall(diagnostic.formatted, numberTo, context);
                        console.log(`calling: ${numberTo}`, JSON.stringify(context, null, 2));
                        await call();
                        process.exit(0);
                    }
                    return;
                }
            }
        }
    }
});

const logger = ailogwatch.createLogger();

export {
    ailogwatch,
    logger
}
```

### Feeding Logs

Feed logs to be analyzed manually or use the logger methods that replace console logging:

```javascript
// Single log entry
ailogwatch.feedLog("2024-09-16 ERROR Database connection failed");

// Multiple log entries
ailogwatch.feedLog([
    "2024-09-16 10:30:25 INFO Server started",
    "2024-09-16 10:30:26 WARN High memory usage",
    "2024-09-16 10:30:27 CRITICAL System overload"
]);
```

The logger also supports console-like methods (`logger.log`, `logger.warn`, `logger.error`) that can be used in place of `console.log`, `console.warn`, `console.error`. These methods accept key-value pairs as additional arguments for structured logging:

```javascript
// Replace console.log with logger.log
logger.log("Server started successfully", { port: 3000, environment: "production" });

// Replace console.warn with logger.warn
logger.warn("High memory usage detected", { memoryUsage: "85%", threshold: "80%" });

// Replace console.error with logger.error (as shown in examples above)
logger.error("Database connection failed", { error: err.message, retryCount: 3 });
```

### Complete Setup with Voice Integration

For full functionality including voice notifications and code analysis, follow these deployment steps:

1. **Deploy the Tools Server**  
   Deploy the required tools server on a cloud platform (Render, Vercel, etc.).  
   Repository: [fragola-cloud](https://github.com/blackboxaicode/fragola-cloud)  
   Follow the README for deployment steps and required environment variables. You'll get a server baseURL (e.g., `https://your-tools-server-url.com`).

2. **Configure ElevenLabs Agents**  
   Clone the AI-logs-watcher repository and set up your environment:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/blackboxaicode/AI-logs-watcher.git
   cd AI-logs-watcher
   cp .env.example .env
   npm install
   ```  
   Run the ElevenLabs configuration script with your tools server baseURL:  
   ```bash
   npm run config-elevenlabs <your_tools_server_baseURL>
   ```  
   This will output `AILOGW_ALERT_AGENT_ID` and `AILOGW_GITHUB_AGENT_ID`. Add them to your `.env` file.

3. **Run the Demo Server**  
   Clone the server-demo repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/blackboxaicode/server-demo.git
   cd server-demo
   cp .env.example .env
   ```  
   Add all required environment variables to `server-demo/.env`:  
   ```
   AILOGW_TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID="<your_twilio_account_sid>"
   AILOGW_TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN="<your_twilio_auth_token>"
   AILOGW_NUMBER_TO="<destination_phone_number>"
   AILOGW_NUMBER_FROM="<twilio_phone_number>"
   ELEVENLABS_API_KEY="<your_elevenlabs_api_key>"
   AILOGW_ALERT_AGENT_ID="<your_alert_agent_id>"
   AILOGW_GITHUB_AGENT_ID="<your_github_agent_id>"
   BLACKBOX_API_KEY="<your_blackbox_api_key>"
   AILOGW_LOG=<boolean>
   ```  
   Install Bun and start the server:  
   ```bash
   bun install
   bun index.ts
   ```

   <Note>
     **Important**: Ensure all environment variables are properly configured. The demo server will simulate database failures and initiate voice calls for testing.
   </Note>

With these steps completed, Blackbox AI Logger will continuously monitor your server logs, detect anomalies, and provide proactive error resolution through voice-powered notifications and interactive assistance.

## Usage Examples

### Logging Errors

Use the created logger to log errors with different severity levels:

```javascript
// Log an error with additional context
logger.error({ error: err.message }, 'Failed to create users table');

// Log an error with the full error object
logger.error({ error: err }, "Failed to recover database connection");

// Log a critical error with status
logger.error({status: "critical"}, { error: err }, "Failed to initialize database");

// Simple error logging
logger.error("Attempted to query users but database is not connected");
```

### Manual Log Feeding

You can also manually feed logs for analysis:

```javascript
// Single log entry
ailogwatch.feedLog("2024-09-16 10:30:25 ERROR Database connection failed");

// Multiple log entries
ailogwatch.feedLog([
    "2024-09-16 10:30:25 INFO Server started",
    "2024-09-16 10:30:26 WARN High memory usage",
    "2024-09-16 10:30:27 CRITICAL System overload"
]);
```
