## Git Integration - Working with Existing Repositories

Robocoder's Git integration allows you to work seamlessly with your existing repositories, giving the AI agent full context of your codebase to provide intelligent assistance, suggestions, and modifications.

### Step 1: Connect to Git
Click the Git integration button in the top-right corner of the Robocoder interface to begin connecting your repository.

### Step 2: Verify via Email
Complete the email verification process to securely authenticate your Git account and establish the connection.

### Step 3: Choose Your Repository
Select an existing repository to work on, or create a new one directly from the interface.

### Step 5: AI-Powered Development
Now the AI agent has full access to your codebase context and can assist you with:

- **Code Analysis**: Understanding existing code structure and patterns
- **Intelligent Suggestions**: Recommendations based on your codebase
- **File Operations**: Reading, writing, and modifying files
- **Testing & Validation**: Running tests and validating changes
- **Code Reviews**: Analyzing code quality and suggesting improvements
- **Documentation**: Generating or updating project documentation

### Step 6: Disconnect When Done
Once you've completed your work, disconnect the repository by clicking the same Git button in the top-right corner and selecting "Disconnect" to safely end the session.
