## How It Works

When you build and deploy your app with Robocoder, you can now ask the agent to add Stripe integration to manage all aspects of in-app purchases. Stripe handles payment processing, subscription management, fraud prevention, and compliance, allowing you to focus on building great user experiences.

## Getting Started

To add Stripe integration to your app:

1. Simply ask the agent to include the Stripe payment requirement in your .

2. The agent will prompt you to provide credentials. You must have the following Stripe credentials:

   - **STRIPE_SECRET_KEY**  
     Go to: Stripe Dashboard → Developers → API keys  
     Copy your "Secret key" (starts with `sk_test_` or `sk_live_`)  
     Keep this confidential - it's for server-side only

   - **NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY**  
     Same location as above (Developers → API keys)  
     Copy your "Publishable key" (starts with `pk_test_` or `pk_live_`)  
     This one is safe for client-side use

3. Use Robocoder's natural language interface to define purchase flows and pricing.
4. Deploy your app with integrated payment capabilities.

That's it you now have an app with payment capabilities integrated right into it via stripe.
