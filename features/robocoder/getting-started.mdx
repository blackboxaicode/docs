### Step 1: Launch Robocoder
Access Robocoder from your BLACKBOX AI dashboard or visit [robocoder.ai](https://robocoder.ai) directly.

### Step 2: Describe Your Vision
Click "New Project" to open the Robocoder canvas and begin your development journey. Describe the application you want to build in the initial prompt. Be as detailed as possible about:
- The purpose and functionality
- Target users and use cases
- Desired features and user experience
- Technical requirements or preferences

**Example prompts:**
- "I want to build a social media platform for sharing recipes, with user profiles, likes, comments, and recipe recommendations"
- "Create a task management app with real-time collaboration, file attachments, and deadline notifications"
- "Build an e-commerce platform with AI-powered product recommendations and integrated payment processing"

### Step 5: Watch Your App Build in Real-Time
Once you've selected your model, Robocoder begins building your application immediately. Watch as your idea transforms into reality:
- See components and features appear live on your screen
- Monitor the AI as it creates your application architecture
- Track progress through each development milestone
- Observe how different parts of your app connect and interact

### Step 6: See Your Initial Application
Within moments, your initial application comes to life. Robocoder creates a fully functional version based on your description:
- Review the generated interface and functionality
- Test the core features and user experience
- Explore the application structure and design
- Identify areas for improvement or customization

### Step 7: Iterative Customization
Now comes the exciting part - making your application truly yours through an iterative process of tweaks and improvements:

**First Round of Tweaks:**
Make your initial customizations and watch them happen in real-time:
- Describe changes in natural language
- Adjust colors, layouts, and styling
- Add or modify functionality
- Refine the user experience
