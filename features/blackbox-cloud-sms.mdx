BLACKBOX AI Remote Agent introduces SMS support, allowing you to interact with remote cloud agents directly via text messages. This feature provides a convenient, hands-free way to assign tasks to agents without needing to access the web platform manually. Simply send a text to the designated mobile number with the repository name, branch, and task details, and the agent will handle the rest autonomously.

### Setup Process

To enable SMS support, follow these steps:

1. **Access Blackbox Cloud**  
   Navigate to [cloud.blackbox.ai](https://cloud.blackbox.ai) and log in using your Google or GitHub account.

2. **Add GitHub Personal Access Token**  
   Access your profile menu and navigate to the "Manage API Keys" section.

   Add your GitHub personal access token. 
   
   You can create one at [Github tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens). Ensure the token has repository access to allow the agent to perform tasks on your behalf.

3. **Add Mobile Number**  
   In the "SMS Notification" section under "Manage API Keys," enter your mobile number. This is the mobile number that you can use to interact with the agent and this also allows you to receive notifications about task progress and completion.

Once configured, you're ready to use the SMS feature. Simply text the agent's mobile number **(+19xxxxxxxxx)** from your configured mobile number to start giving tasks to the remote agent.


### How It Works

Using SMS is straightforward and mirrors the manual process of selecting a repository, branch, and entering a task on the Blackbox Cloud platform:

- **Send a Text**: Provide the details in your message, including the repository name, branch name, and the specific task you want the agent to perform. For example: "Repo: myproject, Branch: main, Task: Add user authentication feature." The SMS agent is clever enough to correct any potential spelling errors in the task, repository name, or branch name, ensuring accurate execution.

- **Agent Execution**: The agent receives the input, processes it remotely, and executes the task just as if you had entered it manually on the site. This includes code changes, testing, and generating pull requests. You can confirm in the UI that the task has been started with the exact details you provided.

- **Convenience and Flexibility**: This feature is ideal for on-the-go task assignment or situations where accessing a browser isn't feasible. It maintains the same level of automation and control as the web interface, ensuring tasks are completed efficiently without manual oversight.

This integration enhances accessibility, making Blackbox Cloud even more versatile for developers who prefer text-based interactions.
