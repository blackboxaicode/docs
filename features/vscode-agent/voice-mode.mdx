# Introduction

Voice Mode is a powerful feature which allows you to interact with the BlackBox AI VSCode Agent using natural speech, eliminating the need for manual typing. Powered by ElevenLabs, this feature provides seamless voice-to-text and text-to-speech conversion, enabling hands-free operation for all agent capabilities.

## Overview

With Voice Mode enabled, you can:

- Perform all tasks available through manual text input.
- Ask high-level or low-level questions about your repository
- Request code edits, new features, or debugging assistance
- Perform all chat-based interactions without using the keyboard
- Receive responses audibly, making it ideal for multitasking or accessibility

The voice processing is handled by ElevenLabs, ensuring high-quality speech recognition and synthesis.

## Enabling Voice Mode

To activate Voice Mode in the BlackBox AI VSCode extension:

1. Open the BlackBox AI chat panel in VSCode.
2. Look for the voice mode button in the chat interface between the add context and the camera buttons.

## Capabilities

Voice Mode supports all standard BlackBox AI VSCode Agent features:

- **Code Analysis**: Ask questions about code structure, dependencies, or functionality
- **Code Editing**: Request modifications, refactoring, or new implementations
- **Debugging**: Describe issues and request debugging assistance
- **Feature Development**: Propose and implement new features
- **Repository Insights**: Inquire about project history, commits, or documentation
- **General Assistance**: Any task you can perform via text chat

## Examples

### Requesting Code Edits

Speak: "Add capability to handle multiple user requests at once in this Java file"

The agent will analyze the code and propose changes, which you can confirm verbally.

### Summarizing the Code Repository
Speak: "What databases are being used in this project?"

The agent will analyze the code repository and explain the contents both through voice and via text on screen.

### Debugging Assistance

Speak: "Why is the API returning 500 errors? Check the logs."

The agent will investigate and provide explanations and fixes.

### High-Level Planning

Speak: "Design a new user authentication system for our app"

The agent will outline the architecture and implementation steps.

## Best Practices

- Speak clearly and at a moderate pace for optimal recognition
- Use specific terminology when referring to code elements or files
- Confirm complex requests by repeating key details
- Utilize the mute function when not actively speaking to avoid accidental inputs
- Review text transcripts for accuracy before proceeding with actions

## Ending Voice Mode

To disable voice mode or to end the current task, click the hang-up/end session button.
