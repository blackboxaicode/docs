## Overview

Orchestration is a powerful feature of the BLACKBOX AI VS Code Agent that enables you to run multiple sub-agents simultaneously. This allows for parallel processing of different parts of a larger feature or bug fix, significantly speeding up development workflows. By leveraging the Blackbox CLI, sub-agents operate in their own terminal instances, each handling specific tasks while the BLACKBOX AI VS Code Agent coordinates the overall process.

## How It Works

The Orchestration feature utilizes the Blackbox CLI to spawn multiple sub-agents, each running in a dedicated terminal. The BLACKBOX AI VS Code Agent:

1. Analyzes the overall task and breaks it down into sub-tasks. Users can also specify how they wish for the tasks to be separated.
2. Provides each sub-agent with the necessary context, instructions, and resources.

3. Monitors progress and consolidates results from all sub-agents.

4. Ensures seamless integration of changes across the project.

This approach allows for concurrent execution of tasks that would otherwise be sequential, reducing development time for complex features.

<Note>
  Orchestration requires Blackbox CLI to be installed and configured on your system. Refer to the [Blackbox CLI Getting Started](/features/blackbox-cli/getting-started) guide for detailed installation and setup instructions.

## Getting Started

To use Orchestration in your VS Code Agent:

1. Ensure you have the BLACKBOX AI VS Code extension installed and configured (see [BLACKBOX AI VS Code Agent](/features/vscode-agent/getting-started)).
2. Verify that Blackbox CLI is set up on your system (see [Blackbox CLI](/features/blackbox-cli/getting-started)).
3. When planning to use the orchestration feature , specify that you'd like to use multiple subagents to speed up the task.

4. The agent will automatically break down the task and spawn sub-agents as needed.

The BLACKBOX AI VS Code extension will create each subagent and will manage their tasks.

## Benefits

- **Parallel Processing**: Work on multiple components simultaneously, cutting down overall development time.
- **Efficient Resource Use**: Optimize time and effort on critical tasks by distributing workload across sub-agents.
- **Testing Multiple Approaches**: Experiment with different implementations for bug fixes or features without sequential bottlenecks.
- **Scalability**: Handle large-scale changes that involve multiple files, modules, or services.
- **Cost-Effective**: Save money by reducing the time spent on manual coordination and testing.

## Use Cases

### Large Feature Implementation

When developing a comprehensive e-commerce platform update involving frontend UI changes, backend API modifications, and database schema updates, Orchestration allows sub-agents to handle each component in parallel:

- Sub-agent 1: Updates React components for the new checkout flow.
- Sub-agent 2: Modifies Node.js API endpoints for payment processing.
- Sub-agent 3: Alters database schemas and migration scripts.

The BLACKBOX AI VS Code Agent then integrates all changes and runs comprehensive tests.

### Bug Fix Optimization

For a complex authentication bug affecting multiple services, Orchestration enables testing multiple fix strategies simultaneously:

- Sub-agent A: Implements a token refresh mechanism.
- Sub-agent B: Updates session management logic.
- Sub-agent C: Modifies error handling in API responses.

The BLACKBOX AI VS Code Agent evaluates the results and selects the most effective solution.

### Refactoring Large Codebases

When modernizing a legacy application with thousands of lines of code, Orchestration can parallelize refactoring tasks:

- Sub-agent 1: Converts class-based components to functional components in React.
- Sub-agent 2: Updates API calls to use modern async/await patterns.
- Sub-agent 3: Implements new TypeScript interfaces and types.

This ensures consistent refactoring across the entire codebase.
