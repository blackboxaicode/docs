## Overview

Robocoder is not just a tool. It's a revolutionary development environment built on the concept of "vibe coding". Instead of writing code line by line, you describe the functionality, the user experience, the architecture and Robocoder's AI collaborates with you to bring it to life. It's a fluid, intuitive, and highly collaborative platform designed for building complex, modern applications at unprecedented speed.

## Key Concepts

-   **Vibe-Driven Development:** Move beyond simple prompts. Define high-level goals, user stories, and architectural patterns, and let the AI handle the boilerplate and implementation details.
-   **Real-Time Canvas:** Visualize your application's architecture and component interactions on a dynamic canvas as you build.
-   **Full-Stack Generation:** From database schemas and backend APIs to interactive frontend components, Robocoder understands and builds every layer of your application.
-   **Iterative and Adaptive:** Easily make changes by describing them in natural language. Robocoder will intelligently refactor the codebase to accommodate new requirements.

## Getting Started

1.  **Launch Robocoder:** Access Robocoder from your BLACKBOX dashboard.
2.  **Start a New Project:** Click "New Project" to open the Robocoder canvas.
3.  **Describe Your Vision:** In the initial prompt, describe the application you want to build. For example: "I want to build a social media platform for sharing recipes, with user profiles, likes, and comments."
4.  **Collaborate with the AI:** Robocoder will generate an initial project structure, procedure. From there, you can refine them further with more detailed prompts.
