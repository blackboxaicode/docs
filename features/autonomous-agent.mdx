description: "Delegate complex development tasks to your personal AI agent and watch it build, debug, and refactor code for you."

## Overview

The Autonomous Coding Agent is your personal AI software developer. It's designed to handle complex, multi-step tasks that go beyond simple code generation. You can assign it a high-level goal, and the agent will plan a course of action, write the code, test its work, and even debug issues it encounters along the wayâ€”all with minimal human intervention.

## How It Works

The Coding Agent operates in a loop:

1.  **Understand the Goal:** It first breaks down your request into a series of smaller, actionable steps.
2.  **Plan the Execution:** It creates a plan, deciding which files to create or modify and in what order.
3.  **Write & Modify Code:** It writes new code or refactors existing code according to the plan.
4.  **Test & Verify:** The agent attempts to run the code or tests to verify that the changes work as expected.
5.  **Self-Correct:** If it encounters an error, it will analyze the problem, debug the code, and try a new approach until the task is complete.

## Common Use Cases

-   **Building New Features:** "Implement OAuth 2.0 Google login for the user authentication service."
-   **Refactoring Code:** "Refactor the `ApiService.js` file to use async/await instead of Promises."
-   **Writing Tests:** "Write unit tests for the `ShoppingCart` class, ensuring all public methods are covered."
-   **Debugging:** "There's a bug causing the checkout page to crash. Find the cause and fix it."
-   **Generating Documentation:** "Analyze the entire codebase and generate API documentation in Markdown."

## Getting Started

1.  **Access the Agent:** Navigate to the "Agent" tab in the BLACKBOX Web App or Desktop App.
2.  **Define the Task:** In the input prompt, provide a clear, high-level description of the task you want the agent to perform.
3.  **Provide Context:** Upload the relevant files or connect the agent to your Git repository.
4.  **Launch the Agent:** Click "Run" and watch as the agent begins working, showing you its plan, actions, and progress in real-time.
