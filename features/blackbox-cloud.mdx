   ![Select Git Repository](/images/blackbox-cloud/cloud_git_repo_select.png)

   <Note>
     **Important**: Due to limitations in the Vercel sandbox SDK, git clone operations are not allowed on empty repositories. Please ensure the selected repository is not empty and contains at least an initial commit.
   </Note>

6. **Start Working**  
   Begin by giving your first prompt to the agent to start working on your selected repository.
