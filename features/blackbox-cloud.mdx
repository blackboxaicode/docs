## Overview

Blackbox Cloud is a remote, browser-based platform that brings the full capabilities of Blackbox agents directly to your workflow. Whether you're working on small fixes or large-scale implementations, Blackbox Cloud allows you to run multiple agents simultaneously, assign tasks to different agent types, and monitor their progress in real-time, all without being tethered to your local device.

Access Blackbox Cloud through your browser to transform how you manage development tasks. Send complex requests to agents that can execute them autonomously in a remote environment, create pull requests, and even perform code reviews. Perfect for individual developers, teams, and organizations managing repositories of any size.

   ![Select Model](/images/blackbox-cloud/cloud_select_model.png)

5. **Select a Repository**  
   Choose the repository and the branch you want to work on from your connected Git repositories.  
   ![Select Git Repository](/images/blackbox-cloud/cloud_git_repo_select.png)

   <Note>
     **Important**: Due to limitations in the Vercel sandbox SDK, git clone operations are not allowed on empty repositories. Please ensure the selected repository is not empty and contains at least an initial commit.
   </Note>

6. **Start Working**  
   Begin by giving your first prompt to the agent to start working on your selected repository.

7. **Run Multiple Tasks Concurrently**  
   Blackbox Cloud supports running multiple tasks simultaneously using various agents. This allows you to work on different features and bug fixes in parallel, improving productivity and efficiency.  
   ![Running Multiple Tasks](/images/blackbox-cloud/cloud_run_multi_task.png)

8. **Set Global Instructions (Optional)**  
   Access the settings menu to configure global instructions that the agent will follow for every prompt. This ensures consistent guidance across all interactions.

With these steps completed, you'll have access to Blackbox Cloud's seamless and intuitive interface for managing your AI-powered development agents remotely. The platform enables agents to create new projects from scratch, enhance existing codebases by adding features and resolving bugs, and manage version control by creating dedicated branches for each task. Upon completion, agents automatically generate pull requests, giving you minimal manual work while maintaining maximum control over changes merged into your main branch.

## Task Overview

When you click on a task in Blackbox Cloud, you'll see comprehensive details about its execution and progress:

- **Status**: Current state of the task (running, completed, failed, etc.)
- **Runtime**: Duration the task has been running or took to complete
- **Model Details**: Information about the AI model used for the task
- **Provider Details**: Details about the AI provider powering the agent
- **Execution History**: Timeline of all actions and steps performed during task execution
- **Pull Request (PR)**: Link to the automatically generated pull request with changes
- **Execution Log**: Detailed log of all commands, outputs, and agent activities during execution, showing live steps the agent takes to make changes

This detailed view provides full transparency into how agents work on your tasks and allows you to review, approve, or modify the generated code before merging.


## Key Features

### Multiple Simultaneous Agents

Blackbox Cloud empowers you to run multiple agents concurrently, each dedicated to different tasks within your codebase. This includes:

- **Blackbox CLI Agent**: Provides terminal-native development experience remotely.
- **Cloud Code Agent**: Optimized for cloud-based code execution and management.
- **Codeex Agent**: Specialized in code explanation, analysis, and review.

This parallelism accelerates development by allowing simultaneous task execution without bottlenecks.

### Seamless Task Dispatch and Management

Easily assign tasks of varying complexity directly from your browser:

- **Quick Fixes**: Minor bug fixes or small code changes dispatched instantly.
- **Complex Implementations**: Long-running feature builds or integrations.
- **Full-Stack Development**: End-to-end application development tasks.

You can select the preferred agent for each task, ensuring efficient resource utilization and tailored execution.

- **Asynchronous Task Execution**: Tasks continue running even when offline.
- **Periodic Status Checks**: Monitor progress at your convenience.

This ensures uninterrupted productivity regardless of your environment.

### Multi-Agent Parallel Execution

Blackbox Cloud also supports multi-agent capabilities, allowing you to select multiple agents for the same task and run them in parallel. This feature enables experimentation with different AI agents using the same prompt simultaneously, with an AI judge evaluating implementations to identify the best and least error-prone solution.

For detailed information and setup instructions, see the [Multi-Agent Execution documentation](/features/blackbox-cloud-multi-agent).
