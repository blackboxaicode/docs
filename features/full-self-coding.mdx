title: "Full Self Coding"
description: "Connect to your production servers and let AI agents autonomously monitor, debug, and fix errors in real-time with comprehensive testing."

## Overview

Full Self Coding is an advanced autonomous feature that connects directly to your production servers, continuously monitoring logs and detecting errors in real-time. When issues are identified, AI agents automatically implement fixes, run comprehensive tests, and ensure stability before deployment - all with minimal human intervention.

This feature transforms your development workflow by enabling proactive error resolution, allowing you to maintain stable production environments while your AI agents work autonomously in the background.

## How It Works

The Full Self Coding system operates through a continuous monitoring and resolution cycle:

1.  **Server Connection:** Connect the agent to your production servers with secure, authenticated access.
2.  **Real-Time Monitoring:** The agent continuously fetches and analyzes server logs in the background, identifying errors and exceptions as they occur.
3.  **Error Detection:** When errors are detected, they are immediately surfaced to both the agent and the user with full context and stack traces.
4.  **Agent Selection:** Choose from different specialized agents optimized for various types of tasks and error scenarios.
5.  **Autonomous Implementation:** The selected agent analyzes the error, plans a solution, and implements the necessary code changes.
6.  **Comprehensive Testing:** Before considering the task complete, the agent runs a suite of tests including:
    - Unit tests for affected components
    - Integration tests to verify system interactions
    - Regression tests to ensure no new issues were introduced
    - Build verification to confirm the codebase compiles successfully
7.  **Stability Confirmation:** Only after all tests pass does the agent mark the implementation as stable and ready for review or deployment.
8.  **Continuous Operation:** The agent continues monitoring for new errors, creating a self-healing production environment.

## Key Features

### Background Server Monitoring
- Persistent connection to production servers
- Real-time log streaming and analysis
- Automatic error detection and classification
- Non-intrusive operation that doesn't impact server performance

### Multi-Agent Support
Choose from specialized agents based on your needs:
- **Debugging Agent:** Optimized for error analysis and root cause identification
- **Performance Agent:** Focuses on optimization and resource utilization issues
- **Security Agent:** Specialized in identifying and fixing security vulnerabilities
- **General Purpose Agent:** Handles a wide variety of tasks and error types

### Comprehensive Testing Pipeline
Every implementation goes through rigorous validation:
- Automated test generation for new fixes
- Execution of existing test suites
- Build and compilation verification
- Performance benchmarking
- Code quality checks

### Real-Time Visibility
- Live error feed showing detected issues
- Agent execution logs and decision-making process
- Test results and coverage reports
- Implementation status tracking

## Common Use Cases

-   **Production Error Resolution:** "Monitor the production API server and automatically fix any 500 errors that occur."
-   **Performance Degradation:** "Watch for slow query warnings and optimize database calls that exceed 2 seconds."
-   **Memory Leak Detection:** "Monitor memory usage patterns and fix any leaks detected in the Node.js services."
-   **Security Patching:** "Scan logs for security exceptions and automatically patch vulnerabilities."
-   **Dependency Issues:** "Detect and resolve package compatibility errors in the microservices architecture."

## Getting Started

1.  **Configure Server Connection:**
    - Navigate to the "Full Self Coding" section in your BLACKBOX AI dashboard
    - Add your production server credentials and log file paths
    - Configure firewall rules to allow agent access

2.  **Select Monitoring Parameters:**
    - Define which logs to monitor (application logs, system logs, error logs)
    - Set error severity thresholds for automatic intervention
    - Configure notification preferences

3.  **Choose Your Agent:**
    - Select the agent type that best matches your needs
    - Configure agent permissions and allowed operations
    - Set testing requirements and validation criteria

4.  **Launch Background Monitoring:**
    - Activate the agent to begin monitoring
    - Watch the real-time error feed for detected issues
    - Review agent implementations and test results

5.  **Review and Deploy:**
    - Examine the fixes implemented by the agent
    - Verify all tests passed successfully
    - Approve changes for deployment or enable auto-deployment

## Best Practices

-   **Start with Non-Critical Environments:** Test the Full Self Coding feature on staging or development servers before connecting to production.
-   **Define Clear Test Requirements:** Ensure comprehensive test coverage to validate agent implementations effectively.
-   **Set Appropriate Thresholds:** Configure error severity levels to prevent the agent from making changes for minor warnings.
-   **Monitor Agent Activity:** Regularly review agent logs and implementations to understand the types of fixes being applied.
-   **Maintain Human Oversight:** While the agent operates autonomously, establish a review process for critical production changes.
-   **Configure Rollback Procedures:** Ensure you have automated rollback capabilities if an agent implementation causes unexpected issues.

## Security Considerations

-   Server credentials are encrypted end-to-end
-   Agent access can be restricted to specific directories and operations
-   All implementations are logged and auditable
-   Optional approval workflows before deployment
-   Automatic session timeout and credential rotation

## Requirements

-   Active BLACKBOX AI subscription with Full Self Coding enabled
-   Server access with appropriate permissions (read logs, write code, run tests)
-   Supported server operating systems: Linux, macOS, Windows Server
-   Minimum required access: SSH or remote access protocol
-   Git repository connection for version control
