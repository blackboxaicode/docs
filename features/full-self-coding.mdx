description: "Connect BLACKBOX AI agents to your production servers for real-time error monitoring, autonomous debugging, and continuous code improvement with comprehensive testing."
---

## Overview

Full Self Coding is an advanced feature that transforms how you maintain and improve production applications. By connecting BLACKBOX AI agents directly to your production servers, you gain a powerful autonomous system that monitors server logs in real-time, detects errors as they occur, and automatically dispatches specialized agents to resolve issues and implement improvements.

This feature enables a proactive development workflow where agents work continuously in the background, identifying problems before they impact users, implementing fixes with rigorous testing, and ensuring your production environment remains stable and optimized.

## How It Works

Full Self Coding operates as a continuous monitoring and improvement cycle:

1. **Server Connection**: Connect your production servers to BLACKBOX AI, establishing secure access to server logs and application metrics.

2. **Real-Time Monitoring**: Agents continuously monitor server logs, tracking errors, warnings, performance issues, and anomalies as they happen.

3. **Intelligent Error Detection**: Advanced AI algorithms analyze log patterns to identify critical issues, categorize error types, and prioritize tasks based on severity and impact.

4. **Agent Selection**: Choose from multiple specialized agents to handle different types of tasks:
   - **Blackbox CLI Agent**: Terminal-native debugging and system-level fixes
   - **Claude Code Agent**: Complex code refactoring and optimization
   - **Codex Agent**: Code analysis and architectural improvements
   - **Custom Agents**: Specialized agents trained for your specific tech stack

5. **Autonomous Implementation**: Selected agents autonomously investigate issues, implement fixes, and make improvements to your codebase without manual intervention.

6. **Comprehensive Testing**: Each implementation goes through a rigorous testing workflow:
   - **Unit Tests**: Verify individual components function correctly
   - **Integration Tests**: Ensure changes work with existing systems
   - **Regression Tests**: Confirm no existing functionality is broken
   - **Performance Tests**: Validate that changes don't degrade performance
   - **Security Scans**: Check for potential vulnerabilities introduced

7. **Validation & Deployment**: Only after passing all tests are changes prepared for deployment, with automatic pull request generation for review.
